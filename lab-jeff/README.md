# Code 401 lab 39

For this lab, we were given 6 sorting methods to choose from. We had to solve 2. I chose heap sort and 3-way quicksort.

## Code Style

Standard Javascript with ES6.

## Getting Started

heap-sort.js contains the heapSort function. It is exported as heapSort.
quick-sort-3way.js contains the quickSort function. It is exported as quickSort.

Both files contain helper functions that should not be used separately.

Index.js is a place to try the code. You must have NodeJS or another javascript environment in which to run the files. Change the values in the array and call either heapSort(array) or quickSort(array). Then run `node index.js` and the result of the sort will be logged.

## heapSort(input)

heapSort has an arity of 1 and expects an array of integers. It returns nothing and sorts the array in place.

## quickSort(input)

quickSort has an arity of 1 and expects an array of integers. It returns nothing and sorts the array in place.
